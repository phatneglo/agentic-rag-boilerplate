# Sample Document for Testing

This is a sample document to test the simplified document processing pipeline.

## Introduction

The document processing pipeline consists of 4 steps:

1. **Document-to-Markdown conversion** using Marker
2. **Metadata extraction** using LlamaIndex tree summarizer
3. **Typesense indexing** with embeddings and content
4. **Qdrant indexing** for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Content

This document contains various types of information:

- Technical specifications
- Project requirements
- Implementation details
- Testing procedures

### Technical Details

The system uses several technologies:

- **FastAPI** for the REST API
- **Redis** for job queuing with BullMQ
- **S3** for object storage
- **Typesense** for search indexing
- **Qdrant** for vector storage

### Key Features

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Single worker handles all steps
2. **S3 Integration**: Files are uploaded to cloud storage
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress monitoring
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Temporary files are cleaned up automatically

## Conclusion

This simplified pipeline provides a more maintainable and easier-to-understand document processing solution compared to the previous multi-worker approach.
